CRYPTABS - it's the concept of a social application for musicians that I created during my Samsung-IT School year. 
It is aimed at a secure procedure for encrypting intellectual property such as tabs for guitar.
More information about this and others my projects you can get by writing a message on salikova.work@gmail.com , I'll be happy to provide it to you.
